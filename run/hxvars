# these options specify the default host address and port to use
# when no address is specified to `/server' and also overrides the
# address/port specified when remote_client is enabled unless
# you allow connections to foreign hosts in the settings below.
# default port is 5500.
#
# example:
#
#    remote_host='localhost'
#    remote_host_port='5500'
#
remote_host='127.0.0.1'
remote_host_port='5500'

# if HOPE and cipher is enabled, hx will attempt to log in to all
# servers using secure login (HOPE). however, you can set the
# default functionality here, whether you want hx to attempt secure
# login or insecure login by default when no specific flags are
# present. you can always specify the particular login type manually
# by passing either -s (for secure) or -o (old, insecure) to the
# `/server' command. for more information see `/help server').
#
default_secure='0'

# for displaying useful information when hx is started, you can
# optionally set this variable to a file path of a file that you
# would like printed out to the user.
#
# example:
#
#    readme='~/hx_readme'
#
readme=''

# when remote_client is set to '1', this setting tells hx whether
# connections to other hosts besides remote_host:remote_host_port
# should be allowed. default is to disallow connections to foreign
# hosts. set this value to '1' to authorize the connections.
# default is to deny connections to foreign hosts.
#
allow_foreign_hosts='0'

# You can enable strict security settings by setting this variable
# to '1' (default is '0'). Turning this feature on disables the
# ability to use `/exec', `/set', `/get', `/hostname -s', `/lcd',
# `/load', `/lpwd', `/put', and `/type' to prevent reading/writing
# to the host machine and/or executing commands on the host.
#
# once remote_client is set to '1', varaibles can no
# longer be modified, so make sure if you change this
# value to 1, that it is the last line in this file.
#
remote_client='0'

# If you would like to automatically load an external file (via the
# built-in `/load' command), set the below variable to the pathname
# of the file that you would like to load.
#
# Alternatively, you can specify commands directly in the file
# `~/.hxrc', which is read upon startup. Though, one advantage of
# setting autoload is that a savvy user can inspect the variable
# using `/set autoload' to see which file they loaded upon startup.
# If you name the file in the autoload variable informatively, it
# can be a valuable way to pass information to your users.
#
# For example, if you set the following:
#
# 	autoload='~/shxd.ath.cx.hxrc'
#
# and then put the following text into the above-mentioned file:
#
# 	set autoload
# 	server shxd.ath.cx
#
# hx will automatically log into the above-mentioned server. Notice
# the first line, which will produce the following line of output
# before logging into the server:
#
# 	[hx] autoload = ~/shxd.ath.cx.hxrc
#
# As usual, if remote_client is enabled (above), this variable is
# stored as read-only upon startup.
#
# As a final note, some administrators may prefer to keep most of
# the details of the setup in this file and have a very minimal
# autoload/hxrc file. In which case, if you set at least the
# `remote_host' variable (above), you can simply place the following
# into your autoload/hxrc file:
#
# 	server
#
# which will invoke connection to `remote_host:remote_host_port'.
#
autoload=''

# When logging into the same server with multiple hx clients with
# the same shell account, it can be difficult to track which client
# is which (without manually identifying each client differently).
#
# To cause the process-ID (PID) of the currently-running instance to
# be appended to the end of your username, enable the below option.
#
# An added benefit is that when you are using hx via an SSH
# connection that prematurely terminates (leaving your hx session
# running in the background), you will know which process to
# terminate by the PID in the username.
#
# Setting `pid_username_force' will cause the PID to be appended for
# all calls to `/nick' (and `/server' with the `-n' option), other-
# wise setting `pid_username' will only append the PID to the default
# username on startup (once `/nick' is called, there is no way to get
# the PID appended to the nick name again unless `pid_username_force'
# is set).
#
pid_username='0'
pid_username_force='0'
